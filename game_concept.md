1. Play as Federation zeros or Klingon heroes.
2. Player's side believes the NPC opponents are encroaching on player's side territory.
2.1 The primary goal of the game is to stop the enemy incursions and to expand the player's own territory.
2.2 There could be other races in the galaxy. Tholians, Orians, Romulans, etc. Some aliens will naturally ally with the Federation player, and some will ally with the Klingon player.
2.3 The civilians or resources must be at risk. The player must feel heroic, making choices to save a planet of civilians or save a crtical space station. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQJA5YjvHDU
2.4 Maybe you have to fight over planets with dilitium deposits.
3. Space stations are used by both sides to refuel and rearm.
4. Destroy space stations to deny them to the enemy.
5. Tutorial mode levels are setup as progressive training simulations for cadets.
6. Tutorial mode level 1 offers the captain unlimited energy and ammo.
7. Tutorial mode limits enemy ships to the level number per sector. Level 1 = 1 enemy. Level 2 = 2 enemies.
8. Friendly ship takes damage in all tutorial levels.
9. Tutorial mode level 2 enables energy and ammo drain.
10. Galaxy is made up of 4 quadrants.
11. Quadrants are made up of 3x3  2D sectors (that's a box of nine sectors).
12. Sectors are a certain size based on level.
13. Sector size is measured in km. 300,000,000km/s = speed of light.
14. Inter-sector travel requires warp.
15. Inner-sector travel requires impulse.
16. If the ship's impulse or warp drive is damaged, that mode of travel is unavailable.
17. Crew can train up on various skills. Maybe just bridge crew. Like world of tanks?
